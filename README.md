# code_hangman

## Summary
There are two folders. The first python folder is for final hand in code. The second c++ folder is my first trial for using frequency of english words which seems to have low rate of guess. 

##Environment:

>	Python 2.7

>	Tested on Mac OS

##Needed files:

>	hangman_ver3.py		

>	words_50000.txt (dictionary)

##Instructions:

Run the code using the following command (in terminal):
	
	python hangman_ver3.py
  


Then it will ask you to input directory of dictionary, for example:
	
	Input the name of file --->words_50000.txt
  
 
	
##Outputs:

>	It will show guess at each step

>	The final result will be like:
			
			Number of words tested: 50,000
			Number of words guessed correctly: 40,000
			Correct Guesses (%): 80.0%
			Time to run: 60 seconds
